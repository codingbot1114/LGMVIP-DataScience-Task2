# Stock Market  Prediction and  Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM
Developing a Stock Market  Prediction and  Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM.
Stock prediction and forecasting using stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a popular approach that leverages deep learning techniques to analyze historical stock data and make predictions about future price movements. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for time series analysis, such as stock price prediction.
